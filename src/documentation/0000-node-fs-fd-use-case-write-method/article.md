# Title

Using `fs.write()` method we can write a file in a more controlled manner in comparision to `fs.writeFile()` or `fs.writeFileSync()`.

## Body Content

Since `fs.writeFile()` and `fs.writeFileSync()` writes the entire content of data in memory before returning, the methods will make sure the entire data is written in a go which in case of huge sized data will have a great performance impact in terms of memory usage and speed of execution of the program.

So, we can manage the above situation by using `fs.write()` method which give us more control over writeing the file. How ? We will see it below.

`fs.write()` Asynchronously writes data to the file referenced by the supplied file descriptor returned by `fs.open()`. Since it's asynchronous in nature which will help not to block our call stack.

Syntax of `fs.write()` method is : 

  Using buffer ::
  `fs.write( fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback )`.

  Using string ::
  `fs.write(fd, string, position, encoding, callback)`
Parameters description:

fd<number> : It is the file descriptor that is provided by `fs.open()` method.

buffer<NodeJS.ArrayBufferView> : It is the a memory allocation to a specific size ( usually in bytes ) which is used to store the bytes write from the file.

offset<number> : It is used to specify where the next I/O operation to be executed in the buffer. Whatever is write from a file is first written to the buffer, so using this parameter you can specify where to start writing in the buffer.

length<number> : It is used to specify number of bytes to be write from the file.

position<number> : It is used to specify from which byte to start writeing in the file content.

string: Writes the string to the file specified by fd.
callback: It is a function that receives err<NodeJS.ErrnoException>, byteswrite<number> and buffer<NodeJS.ArrayBufferView> to which the write bytes where written and stored.


Example ::

```js
const fs = require( "fs" );
const buffer = Buffer.alloc( 1024 );

fs.open( "./myFile.txt", "r", ( err, fdr ) => {

  if ( err  ) {
    return console.log( "LOG_ERROR :: ", err.message );
  }

  fs.read( fdr, buffer, 0, 50, 0, ( er, bytesRead, buffer ) => {

    if ( er ) {
      return console.log( "LOG_ERROR :: ", err.message );
    }

    
    fs.open( "./newFile.txt", "w", ( err, fdw ) => {

      if ( err  ) {
        return console.log( "LOG_ERROR :: ", err.message );
      }

      fs.write( fdw, buffer, 0, bytesRead, ( err, writtenBytes ) => {

        if ( err  ) {
          return console.log( "LOG_ERROR :: ", err.message );
        }

        console.log( " Written bytes :: ", writtenBytes );
      } );
    } );
  } );
} );
```
## Conclusion

At times when you have to handle really big files or you want to write a file based on some spefic conditions, you can just write in chunks or specific chunks of data from a file using `fs.write()` method.
