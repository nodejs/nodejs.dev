WebAssembly is a high-performance assembly-like language that can be compiled from a myriad of languages including C/C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript. As of right now, it is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Node.js!

The WebAssembly specification details two file formats, a binary format called a WebAssembly Module with a `.wasm` extension and corresponding text representation called WebAssembly Text format with a `.wat` extension.

## Key Concepts

* Module - A compiled WebAssembly binary, ie a `.wasm` file.
* Memory - A resizable ArrayBuffer.
* Table - A resizable typed array of references not stored in Memory.
* Instance - An instantiation of a Module with its Memory, Table, and variables.

In order to use WebAssembly, you need a `.wasm` binary file and a set of APIs to communicate with WebAssembly. Node.js provides the necessary APIs via the global `WebAssembly` object.

```js
console.log(WebAssembly);
/*
Object [WebAssembly] {
  compile: [Function: compile],
  validate: [Function: validate],
  instantiate: [Function: instantiate]
}
*/
```

## Generating WebAssembly Modules

There are multiple methods available to generate WebAssembly binary files including:

* Writing WebAssembly (`.wat`) by hand and converting to binary format using tools such as [wabt](https://github.com/webassembly/wabt)
* Using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) with a C/C++ application
* Using [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/) with a Rust application
* Using [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) if you prefer a TypeScript-like experience

> Some of these tools generate not only the binary file, but the JavaScript "glue" code and corresponding HTML files to run in the browser.

## How to use it

Once you have a WebAssembly module, you can use the Node.js `WebAssembly` object to instantiate it.

```js
// Assume add.wasm file exists that contains a single function adding 2 provided arguments
const fs = require('fs');
const wasmBuffer = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/add.wasm');
WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBuffer).then(wasmModule => {
  // Exported function live under instance.exports
  const add = wasmModule.instance.exports.add;
  const sum = add(5, 6);
  console.log(sum); // Outputs: 11
});
```

## Interacting with the OS

WebAssembly modules cannot directly access OS functionality on its own. A third-party tool [Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/) can be used to access this functionality. `Wasmtime` utilizes the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) API to access the OS functionality.
