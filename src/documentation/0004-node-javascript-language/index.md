As a beginner, it's hard to get to a point where you are confident enough in your programming abilities.

While learning to code, you might also be confused at where does JavaScript end, and where Node.js begins, and vice versa.

I would recommend you to have a good grasp of the main JavaScript concepts before diving into Node.js:

* Lexical Structure
* Expressions
* Types
* Variables
* Functions
* this
* Arrow Functions
* Loops
* Scopes
* Arrays
* Template Literals
* Semicolons
* Strict Mode
* ECMAScript 6, 2016, 2017

With those concepts in mind, you are well on your road to become a proficient JavaScript developer, in both the browser and in Node.js.

The following concepts are also key to understand asynchronous programming, which is one fundamental part of Node.js:

* [Asynchronous programming and callbacks](https://nodejs.dev/learn/javascript-asynchronous-programming-and-callbacks)
* [Timers](https://nodejs.dev/learn/discover-javascript-timers)
* [Promises](https://nodejs.dev/learn/understanding-javascript-promises)
* [Async and Await](https://nodejs.dev/learn/modern-asynchronous-javascript-with-async-and-await)
* Closures
* [The Event Loop](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-loop)
