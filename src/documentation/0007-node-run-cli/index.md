The usual way to run a Node.js program is to run the `node` globally available command (once you install Node.js) and pass the name of the file you want to execute.

If your main Node.js application file is `app.js`, you can call it by typing:

```bash
node app.js
```

While running the command, make sure you are in the same directory which contains the `app.js` file.
