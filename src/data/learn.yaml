# This YAML file contains the structural navigation of the Learn Pages
# The section entries here are a Collection of Sections for the Learn Page
# They're ordered in the same way as you define them here.
# The items property of the section uses the `id` of the files which is interpolated from Gatsby's Node fileAbsolutePath.
# Note.: If an item here doesn't exist in the content folder it is ignored.
# Note.: If your Markdown file is inside a subfolder, call it `index.md` and write here the name of the folder
