What is / will be the CommComm's process for approving / adopting design system changes like this?
Most design system changes we make won't effect brand related material, this one does. (In a very limited way, and for very good reasons – read the post!) Does this introduce any other considerations for adoption?
The solution uses an open source color library as a foundation for its design. Does this introduce any other considerations for adoption?
What do you think of the extended color palette solution as a whole? I love hearing feedback on design theory and brand alignment, please share your thoughts freely

* Ask to join marketing team meeting
* Doesn't look like it will conflict with existing brand

Dhruv: Do we fork existing libraries and keep it in Node.js so we have more control over design features?
Adam / Tierney: We want to minimize support costs! Where possible, lets point out to OSS we're leveraging and calling "standard" to reduce our maintenance burdon.

* Identify topics to discuss for Collab Summit Spring 2018 [#29](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/29)

Francisco: Parallel bug to getting started content – what is the getting started experience? What are priorities of "getting started" and docs?

Tierney: Good place to coordinate with TSC and other members across org about how to maintain docs.

* Intend to make docs more accessible
* Developing user personas could support the case of making the docs more readable and accessible
* Good time to work with i18n as well

* Discuss Meeting Time
Agreed to push 1hr back to not torture our USA West Coast members

* Corporate Design Resource Donations
Tierney: Raised the possibility of soliciting designer resource donations from corporate foundation members.
Francisco: Stripe may be interested in providing these resources as well, on a well-defined timeline. Will talk with leads today and report back.
Adam: This WG should function, among other things, as a design management body so as we have resources rotate in and out we still have a cohesive and unified project direction – we will happily take any resources we can get! There is always work :)
