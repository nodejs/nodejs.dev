## Notes

### Requirements gathering

We would like to do it so that the next time a redesign happens, which it will, you donâ€™t have to throw everything out. Should be like a UI consuming docs in markdown.

Does content need to live with the repos that it describes?

There is also content that is an artifact of something else in the ecosystem. e.g.) a list of historical builds, change records, code coverage stats. These will need to be ingested from wherever they live currently.

Should the new website facilitate content from projects like llnode and N-API? Right now the content for these projects lives in their individual GitHub repos. Can/should it be surfaced on the main site? There should be policies/guidelines in place that outline what projects can surface their content onto the main site. Allow groups to opt-in to doing this rather than making it a requirement.

### Hosting sub-projects in the site

* N-API
* llnode
* node-gyp
* canary-in-the-goldmine
* nan
* (docker images we publish)
