### nodejs/website-redesign

* New Home: Nodejs.dev? [#147](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/147)

Recap earlier convo on issue thread.
Question about who is responsible for Nodejs.dev
We’ll need to have a governance chat. It will eventually merge into nodejs.org
Nodejs.dev could be used as a starting point for devs later.
AI: Add website-redesign intro to the nodejs.dev repo

* User Feedback: Node.js Docs Survey  [#61](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/61)

AI: Sync with user-feedback initiative on whether the user feedback meetups can incorporate this

### nodejs/nodejs.dev

* How do we want to add new members? [#127](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/127)

Self-nomination is more encouraging.
Getting nomination from existing contributors could be become a barrier or create a restrictive culture.
No decision made, tabled for next meeting.

* Navigation / Section Proposal [#169](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/169)

For now, we need more data on this issue so keeping it open for now.
