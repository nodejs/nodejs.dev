### nodejs/website-redesign

#### Coordinating "Getting Started" content with NodeSchool content [#18](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/18)
* shouldn't let getting started block us.
* We should start to transition to active content development and high-fidelity mockups – can happen in tandem.
* Should move on the getting started breakout meeting

#### Website Wireframes [#15](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/15)
* Adam: Made updates to reflect feedback on download and releases flow. Will be live soon.
* The homepage needs an iteration for content. For homepage, the content will inform the layout so we'll need to do that first.
* Homepage will need a space for events that the Foundation can push to, and security notifications
* We need tighter feedback loop (such as a dedicated channel in Node.js Slackers or Twitter DMs) between design iterations and users

#### Tech Exploration for In-Browser Node.js Playground [#12](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/12)

* See [RunKit demo](http://nodejs-org-runkit-demo.com/)
* Idea from RunKit: Active Nightly Demos?
* Docs run behind nightlies, dedicated "hot features" page?
* Lock RunKit Node.js version down to docs version
