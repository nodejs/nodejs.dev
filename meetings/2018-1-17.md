## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **wr-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/website-redesign

* \[Discussion\] - Tech Stack Consideration [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/107)

* Idea: Host Docs Hackathons [#99](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/99)
* User Feedback: Node.js Docs Survey  [#61](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/61)

* Node.js Foundation Website IA
  * Latest from Medium
  * Homepage content – ensure it is covered by new HP.
  * Mention of member of the $FOUNDATION! In the "history" section of Learn?
  * Governance section? TSC / CommComm / WGs?
  * Individual membership!?!?!?!? Needs more definition.
  * Application Showcase
    * Tierney: Has this driven value? If it has, awesome, if it hasn't drop / improve?
  * Certification Program
  * Spotlight Videos – maybe? Rachel: How do they perform? Will get numbers. Largely just a pivot page to YouTube – likely cut.
  * Announcements page – maybe just live on Medium? How to reconcile with release announcement page? Can we automate? Can we list latest medium articles anyway?
  * In the news. Tierney: Don't think this is valuable for the nodejs website itself. Can live on new $FOUNDATION website. Not the target audience. Cut.
  * Events! Keep. Make better.
  * Newsletter: Foundation version likely going away with the merger, can possibly be a CommComm owned newsletter. Mohit: Can be a subscribe box/button somewhere, not a full page.
  * Speakers Buerau: Need to check status post Zibby.
  * Resources for Event Org: Keep. Make better. Talk more.
  * Store: keep link.
  * Keep: Social media links.
