* Sub-sites of nodejs.org

### Getting started section #9

* Nodejitsu handed over their Knowledge Base, it's not linked on the website yet.
* Needs to be reviewed, probably outdated but could be a good starting point.
* This will be a longer-term, content-heavy effort that will be a WIP well beyond the redesign launch
* Reach out to NodeSchool, regarding Getting Started content
* Should include multiple approaches to getting started, i.e. web app, FaaS, CLI, etc.
* TODO: Investigate how frameworks and languages implement interactive Getting Started experiences

### Updating Node.js messaging #242 (in CommComm)
* Also discussed in nodejs.org/#1534:
  Examples:
  * http://styleguide.mailchimp.com
  * http://voiceandtone.com
* messaging is old and may have been outgrown
* Existing content in Evangelism repo: Social Media Style Guide
* Must make sure to collaborate with the Foundation to make sure of buy in

### Components library #5
* Paused till future when architecture etc has been determined

### Timeline

* Timeboxing can be demotivating
* Suggested approach: At the beginning of each section (eg. Architecture), estimate how long it'll take, surface in the meeting, update as needed

## Timeline Review:
* 2 week deliverables (architecture phase ongoing): real content for Learning, detailed wireframe
