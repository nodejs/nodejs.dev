Manil made the point of making functional beta versions available so that folks can dogfood (try it out themselves) and give us feedback. We can tell if it is fulfilling the original usecases, by trying to get folks to switch to using our beta version. This could include making sure the core uses (Docs, Downloads) are functional. So we can then iterate on it and eventually supplant people’s needs from the original with our beta version.

We’ve had issues with previews and /gcbrun, where the previews dont always run, or the preview link goes dead after a while.

Saleh brought up wanting to have clarity around how/where to raise issues and ask questions in the project
