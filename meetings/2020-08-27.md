## Meeting Notes

### Diagnostics WG and Website Redesign WG collaboration on diagnostics guides

[#775](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/775)

- Mary is part of diagnostics team, has been unavailable for these meetings
- Changing the label on the core task, Divy/Ben will followup separately

### Use SVG Images for Node.js Features

[#749](<[https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/pull/749](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/pull/749)>)

- There are svg’s on the site currently
- Potential licensing issues with the current images
- Issue can be closed potentially, or at least remove the meeting label tag

### Update CONTRIBUTING

[#737](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/737)

- Discussed briefly last time
- Marcus might have some thoughts
- Main issue: folks aren’t reading the contribution guidelines (maybe?)
- Folks aren’t squashing their commits? It could be part of the merge strategy into the main branch. Or part of the merge template.
- Maintainers will potentially be the folks to handle the squashing behaviours
- Side note: The merge combo button will remember your merge setting

### Marketing text for homepage

[#637](<[https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/637](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/637)>)

- Issue was originally about one thing, has broken into a couple of smaller issues
- Want to use open source projects that use node or nodejs
- There are a couple of open issues for the individual icons
- NPM logo needs to be added (no issue / pr for that yet)
- Process: \* Post to the projects github pages to request that we use their logo on the site and when okayed by a project maintainer then we can PR it in

- Electron logo is available to be updated
- [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/637](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/637)
- [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/818](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/818) _ [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/819](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/819) _

- Add ESLint logo and link to homepage #820
- [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/820](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/820)
- [https://www.figma.com/proto/RepQL7h21unQFvhbEtTwvI/Nodejs.dev-contribution-mocks?node-id=3%3A2&scaling=min-zoom](https://www.figma.com/proto/RepQL7h21unQFvhbEtTwvI/Nodejs.dev-contribution-mocks?node-id=3%3A2&scaling=min-zoom)
- Include the `wr-agenda` label to mark items for discussion at these meetings
- Should we have one pr to handle the logos all updated at a single time: want to keep all three of those logos separately so that the issues can track things separately

### Releases Page: Download Grid

[#261](<[https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/261](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/261)>)

- Marcus talking point: [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/826](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/826)
  Should we use just one styling language: should we use sass and emotion, etc
- Very related to potentially adopting LADR (arch decision records)
- Link to it from the readme
- [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/853](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/853)
  [https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/863](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/863)
- Should be closed when the related PR from johnphamous merges

## Issues looking for help:

- Downloads page: marcus had a start on some styling
- Jem is refactoring code from Sauls previous pr

- Divy working on the community page: is anyone available to help do a working session together.

- Community forum / blog: no major progress there currently. Current nodejs blog focused on releases, whereas other content has been related to other topics

- Topic should come back to the CommComm: how can we make better use of the blog functionality on the site moving forward.

## What’s blocking us from the finish line for the site? What’s mvp task wise?

- Homepage stuff: like logos and marketing text?
- Some of that content will evolve over time
- Focus on the mvp content
- Docs when you click them show up
- Talked about getting an mvp task up so we can put more focus on the issues that need to be addressed for mvp https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/899
