## Announcements

### Discussion

#### Update CONTRIBUTING [#737](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/737)
* Want to make things easier to get started
* Lexie: Quite understandable, was able to move through the issues.
* Ben: Likes some of what marcus suggested around breaking up some of the files.
* Jem: maybe this exists in other issues and we close the issue?
* Ongoing process, we shouldn’t close it, good to link back
* Ben: Is there a reason that info gatherer contributors is in the main readme?
* List is long, maybe we can shorten or move some of that around.

#### Marketing text for homepage [#637](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/637)
* Started as one issue, broken into a couple of different
* Logos for the homepage are a good example.
* Eslint: <https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/820>
* Electron: <https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/819>
* Express: <https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/818>
* Tiago said last time they might pick up some of these tasks
* Comment on issue and ask where it stands,
* OR: Open a new issue and link it to this issue (so we can get the pr done)
* This is an mvp item: gotta get it sorted sooner than later
  * Could make the sub issues a “good-first-issue” and push for folks to pick them up async

#### Releases Page: Download Grid [#261](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/261)

* Jem is working on pulling some of the data out of a former pr and will try to
  push things
* <https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/840>: Alexandria will also help to pick up some of this.

## Q&A, Other

* @nthn__t: Can i pick up some of the tickets?
  Yes! Post it to ticket, lets pick these up individually
