## Agenda

### Notes

#### Website Wireframes [#15](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/15)
* Hot button issue needs input from the release team
* Do we want the package manager included? We have traffic numbers for the package manager page. Bringing that and showing its popularity to the release team may further the cause.

#### Getting started with Node.js [#9](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/9)
* Some of this could actually go into Learn section
* For the embedded runtime: What do we want?
  * We want people to be able to jump in and use it without having the install dependencies
  * We want to build up from JS knowledge and take users into using Node.js
* Do we want to also guide through Express or just explain Node.js core? The power of Node.js is the ecosystem and we should strike a balance. Take a look at how NodeSchool separates Core workshoppers from Electives.

TODO Tierney: Organize another meeting between NodeSchool and the Website Redesign Initiative
