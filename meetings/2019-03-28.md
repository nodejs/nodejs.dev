### nodejs/website-redesign

* CFP for Collab Summit is live! Let's answer the Call for Proposals 📣 [#155](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/155)

Manil: Pace picked up quickly, would be good to see if we're still functioning well.
Sagir: Recap of the process so far and future plans.
Onur: Workshop to get new people on board – Gatsby / React tutorial?

### nodejs/nodejs.dev

* Navigation / Section Proposal [#169](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/169)

* Discussion: report code coverage during travis builds [#206](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/206)

* Discussion: Alternate solutions to provide credit [#201](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/201)

Awais: We can probably use the `.png` after GitHub user profile links to generate a profile image (provided we have the consent, something we could automate via open source consent bot).

E.g.

Profile: https://github.com/AhmadAwais
Profile Image: https://github.com/AhmadAwais.png
Profile Image Resize: https://github.com/AhmadAwais.png?size=90

Tested the API calls via:

```sh
curl https://github.com/AhmadAwais.png
curl https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```
Doesn't seem to be rate limited by looking at the rate.remaining property.
