## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **wr-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/website-redesign

* CFP for Collab Summit is live! Let's answer the Call for Proposals ðŸ“£ [#155](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/155)

Manil: Pace picked up quickly, would be good to see if we're still functioning well.
Sagir: Recap of the process so far and future plans.
Onur: Workshop to get new people on board â€“ Gatsby / React tutorial?
Adam: In the process improve onboarding docs?
Onur: Get good first issues in the issue queue.
Manil: Tuts will be for folks already familiar.
Adam: How we want to tackle API docs

* User Feedback: Node.js Docs Survey  [#61](https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/61)

### nodejs/nodejs.dev

* Navigation / Section Proposal [#169](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/169)

* Discussion: report code coverage during travis builds [#206](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/206)

* Discussion: Alternate solutions to provide credit [#201](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/issues/201)

Awais: We can probably use the `.png` after GitHub user profile links to generate a profile image (provided we have the consent, something we could automate via open source consent bot).

E.g.

Profile: <https://github.com/AhmadAwais>
Profile Image: <https://github.com/AhmadAwais.png>
Profile Image Resize: <https://github.com/AhmadAwais.png?size=90>

Tested the API calls via:

```bash
curl https://github.com/AhmadAwais.png
curl https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

Doesn't seem to be rate limited by looking at the rate.remaining property.
