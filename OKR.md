# Nodejs.dev Objectives and Key Results

The Nodejs.dev project uses Objectives and Key Results to provide direction and guidance to the work we do, enabling our work and the work of our initiatives to have a north star for us to work towards.

## Key Concepts

OKRs consist of two elements:

* Objectives
  * Objectives are qualitative, ambitious, and memorable definitions of the things we as a committee would like to achieve.
* Key Results
  * Key Results are a set of metrics by which we can measure progress toward their objectives. Like objectives, they should be ambitious and overestimate what we can accomplish.
