# Voice and Tone

The content we make available on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is for many different people and teams. They will use it to make decisions about teaching themselves Node.js, using it for their projects, and about contributing to its development.

We can write content that empowers their decisions by being aware of our voice and our tone. What’s the difference between voice and tone?

## Voice vs tone

Your voice is the core of your personality. Voice is consistent across different
contexts, and a well-crafted voice communicates both intent and values.

Your tone will adapt to the emotional state of the person or audience for whom you’re
writing. It would not be a good idea to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s
upset as you would with someone who’s happy.

Over the course of a day, we typically take on different roles. At lunch with others,
we sometimes take the role of a friend. In a team meeting, we often take a
collaborative role. While walking our child to school, we take the role of a parent.
Across all these settings, we are still the same person. In much the same way, our
voice doesn’t change much from in different settings, but our tone changes all the
time.

## Our voice

Node.js’ voice is familiar and relatable. It’s encouraging, as a friend's would
be when you ask for help. It's clear, as a mentor's would be when you ask for
guidance. Our priority is explaining Node.js and helping our users do what they
need with it. We want to educate anyone using our content. We don't want to patronize
or confuse them.

Node.js’ voice is:

* **Helpful**
* **Respectful**
* **Expert**
* **Inviting**

### Examples of voice

The Node.js [Guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/) is one section where content
needs to be instructive. But being instructive should not extend to being bossy. Instead consider inviting your reader to follow the steps you are detailing.

We might say: _"If you'd like to give this a go..."_

Instead of: _"Try it out."_

Formality can be perceived as stuffy or aloof. The Node.js [Get Involved](https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/) section is one place where we want
to be personal and inviting. To achieve this, we may address our reader like
a friend.

We might say: _"You're welcome to chat with us about Node.js core features on our
GitHub issues list!"_

Instead of: _"The GitHub issues list is the place for discussion of Node.js core
features."_

### Humour in voice

When done right, humour is effective at helping us welcome people getting involved in the Node.js community.

This section is intended as a primer on the recommended use of humour in the voice of Node.js

As an open source project, Node.js brings together a mix of different individuals!
This diversity is our strength; well-worth the challenge to be aware that individuals
can have different types of humour. Mixing different types of humour can have
unexpected effects. A subject we are confident is humourous may not have the same
entertaining effect on other people. For this reason, it's recommended that we do
our utmost to empathize with the audience when exercising our sense of humour.

We need to be mindful while maintaining our sense of humour. Humour should be shared, not inflicted.

The Node.js project is honoured to bring together individuals from different cultures
to collaborate on shared objectives! Most people will have had experience empathizing
with others within their culture. Constructively engaging across cultures is a
challenge we are privileged to have. For this reason, we must take extra care to be
aware of cultural variations in what constitutes acceptable humour. For example,
regardless of their cultural endorsement, neither gender nor race is acceptable
humour in the Node.js community. Humour of this nature does not build an inclusive
and diverse environment.

When done with thoughtfulness and care, humour can be encouraging and warm. It can also be damaging when misapplied. If ever in doubt, err on the side of being serious.

## Our tone

Node.js’ tone is usually informal. When writing content or a response, being clear
and direct is always more important than being entertaining.

Actions are also part of tone. A request for help going ignored for many weeks could be perceived as unwanted and unworthy. A quick response, even if an issue itself remains unresolved, shows compassion and thoughtfulness.

It will help to know the audience and the situation when deciding on the right tone. When writing for an audience, think about asking yourself these six questions:

* Who will be reading this content or post? _This is our intended audience._
* What does the reader want? _This is their goal._
* How familar is the reader with the content? _This lets us tailor our answer
to them._
* What situation is the reader in? _This helps us understand why they are here._
* What emotion is the reader feeling at this moment? _This helps us empathise,
to help better._
* How can you maintain (or better yet, improve) the reader's state of mind? _This
is our goal._

When we understand the context to which the conversation belongs, we can adjust
our tone to fit.

### Examples of tone

The [Issues](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues) tracker of the Node.js Help
repo is an example of an area where tone is especially important. Users of Node.js
are opening issues to solicit help. It's often difficult to ask for help! We can
make their experience directly interacting with Node.js a good one by putting thought
into using a tone appropriate to the request.

They might say: _"How do I load another .js file and run that new .js file in a new
global context?..."_

We might respond: _"This would not be recommended. The reason for this suggestion
is \[insert reason here\]. You might also want to take a look at..."_

The response above is direct, yet respectful. It is straightforward and answers
the question with a concrete suggestion. It invites, rather than commands, the person
to make use of a suggested resource.

## Quick style tips ⚡️

These are key elements to get started with writing in Node.js’ voice.

* **Do: Active voice** Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.
* **Don't: Jargon (and slang)** Write in vanilla English.
* **Do: Positivity** Use positive language, instead of negative language.

For details on active voice and jargon, we encourage reading Mailchimp's excellently
written [Grammar and Mechanics Styleguide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/grammar-and-mechanics/), which
inspired this section. For a primer on positive language, we think you'll enjoy
