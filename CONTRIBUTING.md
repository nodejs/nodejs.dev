# Making changes to the Website-Prototype

## Collaboration Policy

- All changes must come in a PR
- All changes must be reviewed by another Collaborator or member of
  @nodejs/website or @nodejs/website-redesign

## Commit Guidelines

There is a built in commit linter. Basic rules:

* Commit messages must be prefixed with the name of the changed subsystem and start with an imperative verb. Check the output of `git log --oneline files/you/changed` to find out what subsystems your changes touch.

  Supported subsystems:

  > build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test

* Commit messages must start with a capital letter
* Commit message must end with a period `.`
