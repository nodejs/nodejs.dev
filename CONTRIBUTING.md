# Making changes to nodejs.dev

## Vocabulary

- A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request,
  or contributing in some other way.
- A **Collaborator** is a contributor who has been given write access to the repository.

## Commit Guidelines

This project follows the [Conventional Commits][] specification.

There is a built-in commit linter. Basic rules:

* Commit messages must be prefixed with the name of the changed subsystem, followed by a colon and a space and start with an imperative verb. Check the output of `git log --oneline files/you/changed` to find out what subsystems your changes touch.

  Supported subsystems:

  > build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test

* Commit messages **must** start with a capital letter
* Commit messages **must not** end with a period `.`

## Collaboration Policy

* All changes must come in a PR
* All changes must be reviewed by a member of @nodejs/nodejs.dev,
  @nodejs/website, or @nodejs/website-redesign
* Pull Requests must be open for at least 48 hours unless included in the special exemptions section below

### Special Exemptions

Pull requests seeking to make any of the following changes do not need to wait 24 hours

* Errata fixes
* Infrastructure Maintenance
* Tests

## Landing Pull Requests

### Before you can land

* The Status Checks for the test suite must pass
* There must be at least one sign off
* There must be no objections after a 48 hour period

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection. During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

## When Landing

* Do not use merge button
* [`squash`][] pull-requests made up of multiple commits
* Land how you like as long as there are no merge commits
