## Introduction

Commits are used to record changes made to a repository. Commit messages are typically brief descriptions of subjects, but can optionally include body and footer. They summarize the changes made so individuals other than the author can quickly understand the work done. They are important for documentation purposes and generating changelogs to name a few.

## Why standardize

Standardizing commit messages is very important from an automation standpoint. Standardizing provides many benefits including automated changelogs, faster forensics when bugs occur, and automated version bumps based on messages.
