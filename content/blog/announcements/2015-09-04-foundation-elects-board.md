“The new board members represent the diversity of the Node.js community and the commitment that these companies have to supporting its overall efforts,” said Danese Cooper, chairman of the board, Node.js Foundation. “Node.js is incredibly important to the developer ecosystem and is increasingly relevant for building applications on devices that are changing the pace of commerce.
