# io.js 1.5.1 Release

On Monday, March 9th, [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg) released io.js [v1.5.1](https://iojs.org/dist/v1.5.1/). The complete change log can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md).

## Notable changes

* **tls**: The reported TLS memory leak has been resolved via various commits in this release. Current testing indicated that there _may_ still be some leak problems. Track complete progress at [#1075](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1075).
* **http**: Fixed an error reported at [joyent/node#9348](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9348) and [npm/npm#7349](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7349). Pending data was not being fully read upon an `'error'` event leading to an assertion failure on `socket.destroy()`. (Fedor Indutny) [#1103](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1103)

## Known issues

* Possible remaining TLS-related memory leak(s), details at [#1075](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1075).
* Windows still reports some minor test failures and we are continuing to address all of these as a priority. See [#1005](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1005).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* Not possible to build io.js as a static library [#686](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/686)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760) and fix in [#774](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/774)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
