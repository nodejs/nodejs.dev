### Node.js News — October 2nd

Node.js v4.1.2 release proposal

### Node.js v4.1.2 Release proposal

This week we have one release proposal: [Node.js v4.1.2](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3128), complete changelog from previous releases can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Node.js v4.1.2 Notable changes

* **buffer**: Fixed a bug introduced in v4.1.0 where allocating a new zero-length buffer can result in the _next_ allocation of a TypedArray in JavaScript not being zero-filled. In certain circumstances this could result in data leakage via reuse of memory space in TypedArrays, breaking the normally safe assumption that TypedArrays should be always zero-filled. (Trevor Norris) [#2931](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2931).
* **http**: Guard against response-splitting of HTTP trailing headers added via [`response.addTrailers()`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_addtrailers_headers) by removing new-line (`[\r\n]`) characters from values. Note that standard header values are already stripped of new-line characters. The expected security impact is low because trailing headers are rarely used. (Ben Noordhuis) [#2945](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2945).
* **npm**: Upgrade to npm 2.14.4 from 2.14.3, see [release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.4) for full details (Kat Marchán) [#2958](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2958)
  * Upgrades `graceful-fs` on multiple dependencies to no longer rely on monkey-patching `fs`
  * Fix `npm link` for pre-release / RC builds of Node
* **v8**: Update post-mortem metadata to allow post-mortem debugging tools to find and inspect:
  * JavaScript objects that use dictionary properties (Julien Gilli) [#2959](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2959)
  * ScopeInfo and thus closures (Julien Gilli) [#2974](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2974)
