### Node.js News — September 11th

Node.js v4.1.0 / io.js v3.3.1 are released

### Node.js v4.1.0 and io.js v3.3.1 Releases

This week we have two releases: [Node.js v4.1.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.1.0/) and [io.js v3.3.1](https://iojs.org/dist/v3.3.1/), complete changelog from previous releases can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Node.js v4.1.0 Notable changes

* **buffer**:
  * Buffers are now created in JavaScript, rather than C++. This increases the speed of buffer creation (Trevor Norris) [#2866](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2866).
  * `Buffer#slice()` now uses `Uint8Array#subarray()` internally, increasing `slice()` performance (Karl Skomski) [#2777](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2777).
* **fs**:
  * `fs.utimes()` now properly converts numeric strings, `NaN`, and `Infinity` (Yazhong Liu) [#2387](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2387).
  * `fs.WriteStream` now implements `_writev`, allowing for super-fast bulk writes (Ron Korving) [#2167](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2167).
* **http**: Fixed an issue with certain `write()` sizes causing errors when using `http.request()` (Fedor Indutny) [#2824](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2824).
* **npm**: Upgrade to version 2.14.3, see <https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.3> for more details (Kat Marchán) [#2822](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2822).
* **src**: V8 cpu profiling no longer erroneously shows idle time (Oleksandr Chekhovskyi) [#2324](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2324).
* **timers**: `#ref()` and `#unref()` now return the timer they belong to (Sam Roberts) [#2905](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2905).
* **v8**: Lateral upgrade to 4.5.103.33 from 4.5.103.30, contains minor fixes (Ali Ijaz Sheikh) [#2870](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2870).
  * This fixes a previously known bug where some computed object shorthand properties did not work correctly ([#2507](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2507)).

### io.js v3.3.1 Notable changes

* **buffer**: Fixed a minor errors that was causing crashes (Michaël Zasso) [#2635](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2635),
* **child\_process**: Fix error that was causing crashes (Evan Lucas) [#2727](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2727)
* **crypto**: Replace use of rwlocks, unsafe on Windows XP / 2003 (Ben Noordhuis) [#2723](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2723)
* **libuv**: Upgrade from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4 (Saúl Ibarra Corretgé) [#2817](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2817)
* **node**: Fix faulty `process.release.libUrl` on Windows (Rod Vagg) [#2699](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2699)
* **node-gyp**: Float v3.0.3 which has improved support for Node.js and io.js v0.10 to v4+ (Rod Vagg) [#2700](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2700)
* **npm**: Upgrade to version 2.14.3 from 2.13.3, includes a security update, see <https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.2> for more details, (Kat Marchán) [#2696](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2696).
* **timers**: Improved timer performance from porting the 0.12 implementation, plus minor fixes (Jeremiah Senkpiel) [#2540](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2540), (Julien Gilli) [nodejs/node-v0.x-archive#8751](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/8751) [nodejs/node-v0.x-archive#8905](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/8905)

### Known issues

See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/confirmed-bug> for complete and current list of known issues.

* Some uses of computed object shorthand properties are not handled correctly by the current version of V8. e.g. `[{ [prop]: val }]` evaluates to `[{}]`. [#2507](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2507)
* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal. [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion. [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).
