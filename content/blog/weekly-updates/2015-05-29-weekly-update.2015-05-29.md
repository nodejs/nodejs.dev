# io.js 2.2 releases

This week we had two io.js releases [v2.2.0](https://iojs.org/dist/v2.2.0/) and [v2.2.1](https://iojs.org/dist/v2.2.1/), complete changelog can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Notable changes

### v2.2.0

* **node**: Speed-up `require()` by replacing usage of `fs.statSync()` and `fs.readFileSync()` with internal variants that are faster for this use-case and do not create as many objects for the garbage collector to clean up. The primary two benefits are: significant increase in application start-up time on typical applications and better start-up time for the debugger by eliminating almost all of the thousands of exception events. (Ben Noordhuis) [#1801](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1801).
* **node**: Resolution of pre-load modules (`-r` or `--require`) now follows the standard `require()` rules rather than just resolving paths, so you can now pre-load modules in node\_modules. (Ali Ijaz Sheikh) [#1812](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1812).
* **npm**: Upgraded npm to v2.11.0. New hooks for `preversion`, `version`, and `postversion` lifecycle events, some SPDX-related license changes and license file inclusions. See the [release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.11.0) for full details.

### v2.2.1

* **http**: reverts the removal of an undocumented `client` property on client connections, this property is being used in the wild, most notably by [request](https://github.com/request/request) which is used by npm. (MichaÃ«l Zasso) [#1852](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1852).

## Known issues

See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/confirmed-bug> for complete and current list of known issues.

* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760) and fix in [#774](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/774)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).
