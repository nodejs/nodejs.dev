# io.js 1.6.4 release

This week we had one io.js release [v1.6.4](https://iojs.org/dist/v1.6.4/), complete changelog can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md).

## Notable changes

* **npm**: upgrade npm to 2.7.5. See [npm CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v275-2015-03-26) for details. Includes two important security fixes.
* **openssl**: preliminary work has been done for an upcoming upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2a [#1325](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1325) (Shigeki Ohtsu). See [#589](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/589) for additional details.
* **timers**: a minor memory leak when timers are unreferenced was fixed, alongside some related timers issues [#1330](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1330) (Fedor Indutny). This appears to have fixed the remaining leak reported in [#1075](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1075).
* **android**: it is now possible to compile io.js for Android and related devices [#1307](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1307) (Giovanny Andres Gongora Granada).

## Known issues

* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* Not possible to build io.js as a static library [#686](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/686)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760) and fix in [#774](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/774)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
