# io.js 1.6.2 release

This week we had one io.js releases [v1.6.2](https://iojs.org/dist/v1.6.2/), complete changelog can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md).

## Notable changes

### 1.6.2

* **Windows**: The ongoing work in improving the state of Windows support has resulted in full test suite passes once again. As noted in the release notes for v1.4.2, CI system and configuration problems prevented it from properly reporting problems with the Windows tests, the problems with the CI and the codebase appear to have been fully resolved.
* **FreeBSD**: A [kernel bug](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2015-March/055043.html) impacting io.js/Node.js was [discovered](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9326) and a patch has been introduced to prevent it causing problems for io.js (Fedor Indutny) [#1218](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1218).
* **module**: you can now `require('.')` instead of having to `require('./')`, this is considered a bugfix (MichaÃ«l Zasso) [#1185](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1185).
* **v8**: updated to 4.1.0.25 including patches for `--max_old_space_size` values above `4096` and Solaris support, both of which are already included in io.js.

## Known issues

* Possible small memory leak(s) may still exist but have yet to be properly identified, details at [#1075](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1075).

* Not possible to build io.js as a static library [#686](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/686)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760) and fix in [#774](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/774)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
