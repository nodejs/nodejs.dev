### io.js and Node.js News — August 28th

io.js v3.2.0/v3.3.0 and Node v4 evangelism, nodejs.org, nodefest/empirenode event.

### io.js 3.2 and 3.3 Releases

This week we have two io.js releases: [v3.2.0](https://iojs.org/dist/v3.2.0/) and [v3.3.0](https://iojs.org/dist/v3.3.0/), complete changelog from previous releases can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### io.js v3.3.0 Notable changes

* **build**: Add a `--link-module` option to `configure` that can be used to bundle additional JavaScript modules into a built binary (Bradley Meck) [#2497](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2497)
* **docs**: Merge outstanding doc updates from joyent/node (James M Snell) [#2378](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2378)
* **http\_parser**: Significant performance improvement by having `http.Server` consume all initial data from its `net.Socket` and parsing directly without having to enter JavaScript. Any `'data'` listeners on the `net.Socket` will result in the data being "unconsumed" into JavaScript, thereby undoing any performance gains. (Fedor Indutny) [#2355](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2355)
* **libuv**: Upgrade to 1.7.3 (from 1.6.1), see [ChangeLog](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/ChangeLog) for details (Saúl Ibarra Corretgé) [#2310](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2310)
* **V8**: Upgrade to 4.4.63.30 (from 4.4.63.26) (Michaël Zasso) [#2482](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2482)

### io.js v3.2.0 Notable changes

* **events**: Added `EventEmitter#listenerCount(event)` as a replacement for `EventEmitter.listenerCount(emitter, event)`, which has now been marked as deprecated in the docs. (Sakthipriyan Vairamani) [#2349](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2349)
* **module**: Fixed an error with preloaded modules when the current working directory doesn't exist. (Bradley Meck) [#2353](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2353)
* **node**: Startup time is now about 5% faster when not passing V8 flags. (Evan Lucas) [#2483](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2483)
* **repl**: Tab-completion now works better with arrays. (James M Snell) [#2409](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2409)
* **string\_bytes**: Fixed an unaligned write in the handling of UCS2 encoding. (Fedor Indutny) [#2480](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2480)
* **tls**: Added a new `--tls-cipher-list` flag that can be used to override the built-in default cipher list. (James M Snell) [#2412](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2412) _Note: it is suggested you use the built-in cipher list as it has been carefully selected to reflect current security best practices and risk mitigation._

### Known issues

See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/confirmed-bug> for complete and current list of known issues.

* Some uses of computed object shorthand properties are not handled correctly by the current version of V8. e.g. `[{ [prop]: val }]` evaluates to `[{}]`. [#2507](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2507)
* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal. [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760).
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion. [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).
