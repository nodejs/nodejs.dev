### Community Updates

* OpenSSL published a [high severity security issue](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2015-July/000037.html), io.js and Node.js have upgraded OpenSSL version and fixed the problem on latest version.
* Node.js LTS WG has updated [their proposed LTS plan](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/blob/master/README.md#example). They need some feedbacks from Noders.
