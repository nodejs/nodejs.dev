### Node.js News

### OpenSSL updates, 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s

Our crypto team will make an impact assessment for Node.js users of the OpenSSL releases. This information may vary depending on the different active release lines and will be posted here.

As part of that impact assessment we will announce our release plans for each of the active release lines to take into account any impact. Please be prepared for the possibility of important updates to Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4 and v5 soon after Tuesday, the 1st of March.

* Expect an impact assessment of the OpenSSL updates within 24 hours of their release
* Expect releases of Node.js v0.10, v0.12 and v5 this week, possibly containing important security releases
* Expect a Node.js v4.4.0 release next with the possibility of a v4.3.2 security update this week

See <https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/openssl-march-2016/> for more information.

Please monitor the **nodejs-sec** Google Group for updates, including an impact assessment and updated details on release timing within approximately 24 hours after the OpenSSL release: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec>
