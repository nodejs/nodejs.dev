# io.js and Node.js News

This week we have one io.js [release v2.3.1](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2015-06-23-version-231-rvagg), complete changelog from previous releases can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Notable changes

* **module**: The number of syscalls made during a `require()` have been significantly reduced again (see [#1801](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1801) from v2.2.0 for previous work), which should lead to a performance improvement (Pierre Inglebert) [#1920](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1920).
* **npm**:
  * Upgrade to [v2.11.2](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.11.2) (Rebecca Turner) [#1956](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1956).
  * Upgrade to [v2.11.3](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.11.3) (Forrest L Norvell) [#2018](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2018).
* **zlib**: A bug was discovered where the process would abort if the final part of a zlib decompression results in a buffer that would exceed the maximum length of `0x3fffffff` bytes (\~1GiB). This was likely to only occur during buffered decompression (rather than streaming). This is now fixed and will instead result in a thrown `RangeError` (MichaÃ«l Zasso) [#1811](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1811).

## Known issues

See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/confirmed-bug> for complete and current list of known issues.

* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760) and fix in [#774](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/774)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).
