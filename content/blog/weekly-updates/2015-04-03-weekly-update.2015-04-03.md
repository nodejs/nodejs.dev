# io.js 1.6.3 release

This week we had one io.js release [v1.6.3](https://iojs.org/dist/v1.6.3/), complete changelog can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md).

## Notable changes

* **fs**: corruption can be caused by `fs.writeFileSync()` and append-mode `fs.writeFile()` and `fs.writeFileSync()` under certain circumstances, reported in [#1058](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1058), fixed in [#1063](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1063) (Olov Lassus).
* **iojs**: an "internal modules" API has been introduced to allow core code to share JavaScript modules internally only without having to expose them as a public API, this feature is for core-only [#848](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/848) (Vladimir Kurchatkin).
* **timers**: two minor problems with timers have been fixed:
  * `Timer#close()` is now properly idempotent [#1288](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1288) (Petka Antonov).
  * `setTimeout()` will only run the callback once now after an `unref()` during the callback [#1231](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1231) (Roman Reiss).
  * NOTE: there are still other unresolved concerns with the timers code, such as [#1152](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1152).
* **Windows**: a "delay-load hook" has been added for compiled add-ons on Windows that should alleviate some of the problems that Windows users may be experiencing with add-ons in io.js [#1251](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1251) (Bert Belder).
* **V8**: minor bug-fix upgrade for V8 to 4.1.0.27.
* **npm**: upgrade npm to 2.7.4. See [npm CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v274-2015-03-20) for details.

## Known issues

* Some problems exist with timers and `unref()` still to be resolved. See [#1152](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1152).
* Possible small memory leak(s) may still exist but have yet to be properly identified, details at [#1075](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1075).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* Not possible to build io.js as a static library [#686](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/686)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760) and fix in [#774](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/774)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
