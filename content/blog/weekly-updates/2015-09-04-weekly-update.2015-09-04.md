### Node.js News — September 4th

Node.js v4.0.0 is released

### Node.js v4.0.0

This week is the most historical week. Finally we have released Node.js v4.0.0(stable). Thanks to the every Node/io.js collaborator. This Node.js is the most stable Node ever. We have reviewed all of patches and the state of the test suite is more stable and there are more active contributors in new Node.

We would like to talk about this news, changes, features. But currently we don't have so much spaces and times. We hope that Node community will post more blog entries or more news.

### Node.js v4.0.0 Notable changes

This list of changes is relative to the last io.js v3.x branch release, v3.3.0. Please see the list of notable changes in the v3.x, v2.x and v1.x releases for a more complete list of changes from 0.12.x. Note, that some changes in the v3.x series as well as major breaking changes in this release constitute changes required for full convergence of the Node.js and io.js projects.

* **child\_process**: `ChildProcess.prototype.send()` and `process.send()` operate asynchronously across all platforms so an optional callback parameter has been introduced that will be invoked once the message has been sent, i.e. `.send(message[, sendHandle][, callback])` (Ben Noordhuis) [#2620](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2620).
* **node**: Rename "io.js" code to "Node.js" (cjihrig) [#2367](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2367).
* **node-gyp**: This release bundles an updated version of node-gyp that works with all versions of Node.js and io.js including nightly and release candidate builds. From io.js v3 and Node.js v4 onward, it will only download a headers tarball when building addons rather than the entire source. (Rod Vagg) [#2700](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2700)
* **npm**: Upgrade to version 2.14.2 from 2.13.3, includes a security update, see <https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.2> for more details, (Kat Marchán) [#2696](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2696).
* **timers**: Improved timer performance from porting the 0.12 implementation, plus minor fixes (Jeremiah Senkpiel) [#2540](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2540), (Julien Gilli) [nodejs/node-v0.x-archive#8751](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/8751) [nodejs/node-v0.x-archive#8905](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/8905)
* **util**: The `util.is*()` functions have been deprecated, beginning with deprecation warnings in the documentation for this release, users are encouraged to seek more robust alternatives in the npm registry, (Sakthipriyan Vairamani) [#2447](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2447).
* **v8**: Upgrade to version 4.5.103.30 from 4.4.63.30 (Ali Ijaz Sheikh) [#2632](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2632).
  * Implement new `TypedArray` prototype methods: `copyWithin()`, `every()`, `fill()`, `filter()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`, `forEach()`, `indexOf()`, `join()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `map()`, `reduce()`, `reduceRight()`, `reverse()`, `slice()`, `some()`, `sort()`. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray> for further information.
  * Implement new `TypedArray.from()` and `TypedArray.of()` functions. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray> for further information.
  * Implement arrow functions, see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions> for further information.
  * Full ChangeLog available at <https://github.com/v8/v8-git-mirror/blob/4.5.103/ChangeLog>

### Known issues

See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/confirmed-bug> for complete and current list of known issues.

* Some uses of computed object shorthand properties are not handled correctly by the current version of V8. e.g. `[{ [prop]: val }]` evaluates to `[{}]`. [#2507](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2507)
* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal. [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion. [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).
