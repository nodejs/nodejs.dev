### io.js and Node.js News — August 21st

io.js v3.1.0 and the v0.12 LTS plan, ARM build, nodeday event.

### io.js v3.1.0 Release

### Notable changes

* **buffer**: Fixed a couple large memory leaks (Ben Noordhuis) [#2352](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2352).
* **crypto**:
  * Fixed a couple of minor memory leaks (Karl Skomski) [#2375](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2375).
  * Signing now checks for OpenSSL errors (P.S.V.R) [#2342](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2342). **Note that this may expose previously hidden errors in user code.**
* **intl**: Intl support using small-icu is now enabled by default in builds (Steven R. Loomis) [#2264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2264).
  * [`String#normalize()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize) can now be used for unicode normalization.
  * The [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) object and various `String` and `Number` methods are present, but only support the English locale.
  * For support of all locales, node must be built with [full-icu](https://github.com/nodejs/node#build-with-full-icu-support-all-locales-supported-by-icu).
* **tls**: Fixed tls throughput being much lower after an incorrect merge (Fedor Indutny) [#2381](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2381).
* **tools**: The v8 tick processor now comes bundled with node (Matt Loring) [#2090](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2090).
  * This can be used by producing performance profiling output by running node with `--perf`, then running your appropriate platform's script on the output as found in [tools/v8-prof](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/tools/v8-prof).
* **util**: `util.inspect(obj)` now prints the constructor name of the object if there is one (Christopher Monsanto) [#1935](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/1935).

### Known issues

See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/confirmed-bug> for complete and current list of known issues.

* Some problems with unreferenced timers running during `beforeExit` are still to be resolved. See [#1264](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1264).
* Surrogate pair in REPL can freeze terminal. [#690](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/690)
* `process.send()` is not synchronous as the docs suggest, a regression introduced in 1.0.2, see [#760](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/760).
* Calling `dns.setServers()` while a DNS query is in progress can cause the process to crash on a failed assertion. [#894](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/894)
* `url.resolve` may transfer the auth portion of the url when resolving between two full hosts, see [#1435](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1435).

### Node.js v0.12 LTS plan has been shortened

* Node.js v0.12 LTS plan has been shortened to end at the end of 2016, because OpenSSL 1.0.1 LTS is scheduled until the end of 2016. The detail is [here](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/pull/36).

### Community Updates

* We _still_ need a V8 maintainer for our LTS build! Head on over [to GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/issues/28) to see if the requirements match your capabilities.
* [Marko Bonaći](https://github.com/mbonaci) published [his blog post](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/07/15/logging-cli-writing-first-node-project/) about his first useful Node.js product which can search log files.
* [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) updated [his post about the state of the Node.js build on ARM](https://medium.com/@rvagg/node-js-io-js-state-of-the-build-arm-2f24c18e1ab4). In the entry, Rod details how Node core members test and build Node.js for ARM hardware.
