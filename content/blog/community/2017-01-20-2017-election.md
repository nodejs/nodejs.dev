The Node.js Foundation is a member-supported organization. The Node.js
Foundation Individual Director is the Node.js project’s community voice on the
board. There are two individual directors that sit on the Node.js Foundation
board and they serve a two-year term.

> “Having the community represented is extremely important for open source
> projects with a Board of Directors as diverse as ours. This gives the community
> a voice on the board and helps to guide how we make the investment decisions.
> The individual board members are able to provide feedback on how proposed board
> items might impact the community and can provide suggestions on how the Node.js
> Foundation can better support the community. With this knowledge and feedback,
> the board is able to contribute the resources the community needs to stay
> healthy and continue to grow.”
>
> _Todd Moore, Node.js Foundation Director_

The Individual Membership Director is responsible for soliciting feedback and
data that represents the wishes of other individual members and the community at
large. They have been entrusted with the duty to make decisions based on the
information they receive to best represent the community, and can gather input
for proposals when relevant and granted permission to do so.

This includes participating and voting in Board meetings, introducing and
driving forward initiatives to conclusion that capture the mission of the
Node.js project, and representing the Board at speaking engagements (this is by
no means a comprehensive list). Read more about [“What’s it like being on the
Node.js Foundation Board of
Directors?”](https://medium.com/@nodejs/whats-it-like-being-on-the-node-js-foundation-board-of-directors-f9456b8b7c4d).

### What does the Board of Directors do?

The Board meets every month to approve resolutions and discuss Node.js
Foundation administrative matters. This includes legal considerations, budgeting
and approving Foundation-led conferences and other initiatives. Technical
governance is overseen by the TSC, not the Board of Directors.

The current board members are listed
[here](https://foundation.nodejs.org/board).
