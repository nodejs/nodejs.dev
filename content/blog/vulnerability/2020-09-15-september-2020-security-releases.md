### HTTP Request Smuggling due to CR-to-Hyphen conversion (High) (CVE-2020-8201)

Affected Node.js versions converted carriage returns in HTTP request headers to a hyphen before parsing. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling as it is a non-standard interpretation of the header.

Thank you to Amit Klein who works at Safebreach for reporting this vulnerability.

### Denial of Service by resource exhaustion CWE-400 due to unfinished HTTP/1.1 requests (Critical) (CVE-2020-8251)

Node.js is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DOS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept new connections. The fix a new http.Server option called requestTimeout
with a default value of 0 which means it is disabled by default. This should be set when Node.js is used as an edge server, for more details refer to the documentation.

Impacts:
* All versions of the 14.x release line

Thank you to Paolo Insogna and Matteo Collina who work at NearFom for reporting and fixing this vulnerability.

### fs.realpath.native may cause buffer overflow (Medium) (CVE-2020-8252)

libuv's realpath implementation incorrectly determined the buffer size which can result in a buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.

Impacts:
