title: V8 Memory Corruption and Stack Overflow (fixed in Node v0.8.28 and v0.10.30)
blogAuthors: ['node-js-website']

---

A memory corruption vulnerability, which results in a denial-of-service, was
identified in the versions of V8 that ship with Node.js 0.8 and 0.10. In
certain circumstances, a particularly deep recursive workload that may trigger
a GC and receive an interrupt may overflow the stack and result in a
segmentation fault. For instance, if your work load involves successive
`JSON.parse` calls and the parsed objects are significantly deep, you may
experience the process aborting while parsing.

This issue was identified by Tom Steele of [^Lift
Security](https://liftsecurity.io/) and Fedor Indunty, Node.js Core Team member
worked closely with the V8 team to find our resolution.

The V8 issue is described here https://codereview.chromium.org/339883002

It has landed in the Node repository here:
https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/530af9cb8e700e7596b3ec812bad123c9fa06356

And has been released in the following versions:

* [v0.10.30](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.30)
* [v0.8.28](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.28)

### The Fix

### Remediation

The best course of action is to patch or upgrade Node.js.

### Mitigation

To mitigate against deep JSON parsing you can limit the size of the string you
parse against, or ban clients who trigger a `RangeError` for parsing JSON.

There is no specific maximum size of a JSON string, though keeping the max to
the size of your known message bodies is suggested. If your message bodies
cannot be over 20K, there's no reason to accept 1MB bodies.

For web frameworks that do automatic JSON parsing, you may need to configure
the routes that accept JSON payloads to have a maximum body size.

* [expressjs](http://expressjs.com) and [krakenjs](http://krakenjs.com) used with the [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#bodyparserjsonoptions) plugin accepts a `limit` parameter in your JSON config
* [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com) has `payload.maxBytes` https://github.com/spumko/hapi/blob/master/docs/Reference.md
* [restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/#Bundled-Plugins) bundled `bodyParser` accepts a `maxBodySize`
