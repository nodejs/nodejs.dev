## _(Update 18-December-2019)_ Releases available

These releases update npm to v6.13.4 to address three vulnerabilities described below.

All current release lines were affected.

At this time, CVEs have been requested by npm, Inc. and are pending review. See https://twitter.com/ahmadnassri/status/1205132161961123841 for more information.

### Global `node_modules` Binary Overwrite

Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to a Global `node_modules` Binary Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations.

For example, if a package was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite the first binary. This will not overwrite system binaries but only binaries put into the global `node_modules` directory.

This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the `--ignore-scripts` install option.

### Symlink reference outside of `node_modules`

Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to a symlink reference outside of `node_modules`. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of the `node_modules` folder through the `bin` field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json `bin` field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user’s system when the package is installed. Only files accessible by the user running the `npm install` are affected.

This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the `--ignore-scripts` install option.

### Arbitrary File Write

Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended `node_modules` folder through the `bin` field. A properly constructed entry in the `package.json` bin field would allow a package publisher to create files on a user's system when the package is installed. It is only possible to affect files that the user running `npm install` has access to and it is not possible to overwrite files that already exist on disk.

This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the `--ignore-scripts` install option.

## Summary

The Node.js project will release new versions of all supported release lines on or shortly after Tuesday December 17, 2019 UTC. For versions 8, 10, and 12 the only update to the runtime in these releases will be an updated version of npm addressing the vulnerability announced in https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli. Version 13, while still being a security release, will include all commits that were scheduled to be included in the originally scheduled release.

In the meantime, users should update to npm 6.13.4 by following the instructions provided in the npm advisory. As a general rule, avoid running npm in production environments.

## Impact

All versions of Node.js are vulnerable including the LTS and current releases: Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon"), Node.js 10 (LTS "Dubnium") , Node.js 12 (LTS "Erbium"), and Node.js 13.

## Release timing

Releases will be available at, or shortly after, Tuesday, December 17, 2019 UTC.
