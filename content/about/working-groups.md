### [Addon API](https://github.com/nodejs/nan)

The Addon API Working Group is responsible for maintaining the NAN project and
corresponding _nan_ package in npm. The NAN project makes available an
abstraction layer for native add-on authors for Node.js,
assisting in the writing of code that is compatible with many actively used
versions of Node.js, V8 and libuv.

Responsibilities include:

* Maintaining the [NAN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) GitHub repository,
  including code, issues and documentation.
* Maintaining the [addon-examples](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples)
  GitHub repository, including code, issues and documentation.
* Maintaining the C++ Addon API within the Node.js project, in subordination to
  the Node.js TSC.
* Maintaining the Addon documentation within the Node.js project, in
  subordination to the Node.js TSC.
* Maintaining the _nan_ package in npm, releasing new versions as appropriate.
* Messaging about the future of the Node.js and NAN interface to give the
  community advance notice of changes.

The current members can be found in their
[README](https://github.com/nodejs/nan#collaborators).

### [Build](https://github.com/nodejs/build)

The Build Working Group's purpose is to create and maintain a distributed
automation infrastructure.

Responsibilities include:

* Producing packages for all target platforms.
* Running tests.
* Running performance testing and comparisons.
* Creating and managing build-containers.

### [Diagnostics](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics)

The Diagnostics Working Group's purpose is to surface a set of comprehensive,
documented, and extensible diagnostic interfaces for use by Node.js tools and
JavaScript VMs.

Responsibilities include:

* Collaborating with V8 to integrate `v8_inspector` into Node.js.
* Collaborating with V8 to integrate `trace_event` into Node.js.
* Collaborating with Core to refine `async_wrap` and `async_hooks`.
* Maintaining and improving OS trace system integration (e.g. ETW, LTTNG, dtrace).
* Documenting diagnostic capabilities and APIs in Node.js and its components.
* Exploring opportunities and gaps, discussing feature requests, and addressing
  conflicts in Node.js diagnostics.
* Fostering an ecosystem of diagnostics tools for Node.js.
* Defining and adding interfaces/APIs in order to allow dumps to be generated
  when needed.
* Defining and adding common structures to the dumps generated in order to
  support tools that want to introspect those dumps.

### [Docker](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node)

The Docker Working Group's purpose is to build, maintain, and improve official
Docker images for the Node.js project.

Responsibilities include:

* Keeping the official Docker images updated in line with new Node.js releases.
* Decide and implement image improvements and/or fixes.
* Maintain and improve the images' documentation.

### [Evangelism](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism)

The Evangelism Working Group promotes the accomplishments
of Node.js and lets the community know how they can get involved.

Responsibilities include:

* Facilitating project messaging.
* Managing official project social media.
* Handling the promotion of speakers for meetups and conferences.
* Handling the promotion of community events.
* Publishing regular update summaries and other promotional
  content.

### [i18n](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n)

The i18n Working Groups handle more than just translations. They
are endpoints for community members to collaborate with each
other in their language of choice.

Each team is organized around a common spoken language. Each
language community might then produce multiple localizations for
various project resources.

Responsibilities include:

* Translating any Node.js materials they believe are relevant to their
  community.
* Reviewing processes for keeping translations up to date and of high quality.
* Managing and monitoring social media channels in their language.
* Promoting Node.js speakers for meetups and conferences in their language.

Each language community maintains its own membership.

  GitHub organization including but not limited to:
  * Managing the list of organization owners which supplement the standard
    Node.js organization owners as outlined in: <https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/GITHUB_ORG_MANAGEMENT_POLICY.md#owners>
  * Overseeing new repositories (creating, moving, removing)

### [Release](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

The Release Working Group manages the release process for Node.js.

Responsibilities include:

* Define the release process.
* Define the content of releases.
* Generate and create releases.
* Test Releases.
* Manage the Long Term Support and Current branches including
  backporting changes to these branches.
* Define the policy for what gets backported to release streams

### [Security](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg)

The Security Working Group manages all aspects and processes linked to Node.js security.

Responsibilities include:

* Define and maintain security policies and procedures for:
  * the core Node.js project
  * other projects maintained by the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
* Work with the Node Security Platform to bring community vulnerability data into
  the foundation as a shared asset.
* Ensure the vulnerability data is updated in an efficient and timely manner.
  For example, ensuring there are well-documented processes for reporting
  vulnerabilities in community modules.
* Review and recommend processes for handling of security reports (but not the
  actual administration of security reports, which are reviewed by a group of people
  directly delegated to by the TSC).
* Define and maintain policies and procedures for the coordination of security
  concerns within the external Node.js open source ecosystem.
* Offer help to npm package maintainers to fix high-impact security bugs.
* Maintain and make available data on disclosed security vulnerabilities in:
  * the core Node.js project
  * other projects maintained by the Node.js Foundation technical group
  * the external Node.js open source ecosystem
* Promote the improvement of security practices within the Node.js ecosystem.
* Recommend security improvements for the core Node.js project.
* Facilitate and promote the expansion of a healthy security service and product
  provider ecosystem.

### [Streams](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream)

The Streams Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of the
Streams API as used in Node.js and the npm ecosystem. We seek to create a
composable API that solves the problem of representing multiple occurrences
of an event over time in a humane, low-overhead fashion. Improvements to the
API will be driven by the needs of the ecosystem; interoperability and
backwards compatibility with other solutions and prior versions are paramount
in importance.

Responsibilities include:

* Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.
* Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.
* Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.
* Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this project.
* Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.
* Recommending versions of `readable-stream` to be included in Node.js.
* Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance notice of changes.
