The Node.js trademarks, service marks, and graphics marks are symbols of the
quality, performance, and ease of use that people have come to associate with
the Node.js software and project. To ensure that the Node.js marks continue to
symbolize these qualities, we must ensure that the marks are only used in ways
that do not mislead people or cause them to confuse Node.js with other software
of lower quality. If we don’t ensure the marks are used in this way, it cannot
only confuse users, it can make it impossible to use the mark to protect
against people who maliciously exploit the mark in the future. The primary goal
of this policy is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to the Node.js mark, so
that the community and users of Node.js are always protected in the future.

At the same time, we’d like community members to feel comfortable spreading the
word about Node.js and participating in the Node.js community. Keeping that
goal in mind, we’ve tried to make the policy as flexible and easy to understand
as legally possible.

The OpenJS Foundation has a perpetual license to use the
[Node.js marks](https://ip-policy.openjsf.org).
For more details on using the Node.js mark, please read the
[full policy](https://trademark-policy.openjsf.org).
If you have any questions don't hesitate to

Guidelines for the visual display of the Node.js mark are described in
the [Visual Guidelines](/static/documents/foundation-visual-guidelines.pdf).
