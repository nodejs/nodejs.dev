As you try to understand the Node.js event loop, one important part of it is `process.nextTick()`. Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick.

When we pass a function to `process.nextTick()`, we instruct the engine to invoke this function at the end of the current operation, before the next event loop tick starts:

```js
process.nextTick(() => {
  // do something
});
```

The event loop is busy processing the current function code. When this operation ends, the JS engine runs all the functions passed to `nextTick` calls during that operation.

It's the way we can tell the JS engine to process a function asynchronously (after the current function), but as soon as possible, not queue it.

Calling `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` will execute the function at the end of next tick, much later than when using `nextTick()` which prioritizes the call and executes it just before the beginning of the next tick.

Use `nextTick()` when you want to make sure that in the next event loop iteration that code is already executed.

#### An Example of the order of events:
```js
console.log("Hello => number 1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("The timeout running last => number 4");
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log("Running before the timeout => number 3");
});

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log("Running at next tick => number 2");
});

```
#### Output:
```bash
Hello => number 1
Running at next tick => number 2
The timeout running last => number 4
Running before the timeout => number 3
```
